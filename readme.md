Kotegawa Yui is a secondary female protagonist, who is in Rito's class throughout the second year. She is the head of the school disciplinary committee.

She is a high-strung girl, has a strong tsundere personality, and is very strict against improper behavior. Like most of the other girls in the series, she also becomes a love interest of Rito, although she is more reluctant to admit it to herself than most of them, due to her tsundere personality.
